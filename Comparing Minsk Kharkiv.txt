I want to compare two cities,Minsk and Kharkiv, where I had lived during last 10 years.

Minsk is a capital of Belarus and this is the biggest city in the country.
Area of two cities is very similar about 30000 km2, but Minsk is little bit more.

After Second World War Minsk was destroyed and today it's buildings looks more modern than in Kharkiv, but 'First capital of Ukraine' has more beautiful old town, 
oldest buildins, more comfortable patios.
Kharkiv is very famous about it's largest square in Europe - Mayday Svobody.
In Minsk streets are more wide and more speed, but in Kharkiv streets are more historical and valueable with architectural poitns of view.
Kharkiv is the biggest students' city in Ukraine. Kharkiv's students community more international than in Minsk. 
This two cities were strategic industrial centres in USSR, 
but today Minsk saved more numbers of industrial plants than Kharkiv.
Kharkiv has more scientific potential than Minsk, and I hope It can be inplemented in real life.

IT industry is driver of economy and two cities has a great potential to growth, but Kharkiv does this more faster,
 because Minsk has reached growing point, I think.
